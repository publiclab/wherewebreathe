WhereWeBreathe is an open source web application created by Public Lab (http://publiclab.org), which plays two distinct functions:

* it creates a community forum for people who live in manufactured housing, and whose health has been affected by indoor air quality issues 
* it hosts a questionnaire as part of study on the indoor air quality health issues experienced by those who live in manufactured housing

The site lives at WhereWeBreathe.org
